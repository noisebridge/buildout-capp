# buildout-capp
For organizing some of the buildout for the new space on Capp.

File projects as issues, then add them to the project board (https://github.com/noisebridge/buildout-capp/projects). 
Tag each with the area it's in (or whatever other tags you find useful).
Assign it to someone who is a good point of contact for that task.

List of areas (to use for tagging): https://github.com/noisebridge/buildout-capp/wiki
